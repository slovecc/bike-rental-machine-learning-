# bike-rental-machine-learning-

The program  analyses a bike rental dataset and  applies a model
of machine learning. It permits to choose between two models:

The two models used are the support vector and random
forest classifications by means of the machine learning algorithms available from the
Python (scikit-learn) library.

The dataset is taken from a kaggle competition.

 I used Python (Python 2.7) in Linux Environment.
